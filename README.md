## Description
Browser extension for making daily codeforces usage a little more **convenient** with easier problem searching and more **exciting** with a randomizer and hardcore mode (hides problem tags and rating). Main idea behind this project was that superfluous things like unknown tags or high problem rating on codeforces can often deter us from even attempting to solve it even though we may actually be able to do so. By hiding those things with hardcore mode programmer can solely focus on the problem at hand and tackle it even if it is outside of their skillset (which is what makes us better).
